              Hello! My name is Liz Levine, and I'm originally from Detroit,
              Michigan. I've been living in Manhattan since the 1980's when the
              city had a very different look and feel than it does today. I've
              have the priviledge to explore different career paths and develop
              many interests and hobbies. I began working in publishing, then
              entered the fashion industry working in the luxury market sector
              buying, selling & merchandising. I spent more than a decade in the
              interior design industry collaborating with architects, designers,
              and project managers on commercial, hospitality and high end
              residential projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like many New Yorkers, I found the urban life all too demanding.
              This is when I took and interest in health and wellness and
              discovered my passion for the then unknown, Pilates Method. I was
              blessed to study directly under the renowned Romana Kryzanowska
              (the only living decendent and apprentice to Joseph Pilates).
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, I spend much of my free time with Reiki, my beloved
              two-year-old Basenji who is pictured here as a 12-week-old puppy.
              He comes from a long line of AKC Grand Champions and is following
              in his ancestors's paw-steps, competing for his championship
              title. Much of my free time is spent training and grooming him for
              the show ring!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're interested in learning more about this unique,
              exquisite, and ancient Basenji breed, please visit my
              (still-in-progress) "passion project" website site
